@lancereddick Thank you for your support!
And never forget that history should and will judge all of us if we ever let the American dream die. #NPCLunch
"Remember the greatness of our country, and the sacrifices that have gone before us. #NPCLunch"
The way to solve these challenges and others is the way that other such challenges have always been solved in the past.  Find good leaders.
We'd benefit by taking a deep breath and auditing the entire federal government to re-justify the functioning of every program and office
"The administration of our government needs to be fixed.  With the right leadership and the right sense of priorities, it can be #NPCLunch"
A lot of people running for President seem to skip past the realities of governing into the circus of the political debate  #NPCLunch
It is possible to rebalance the relationship between the executive and legislative branches #NPCLunch
"Do you want former offenders on the street coming after your money or life, or do you want them in a job, making money and having a life?"
"When one applies for a job, the stigma of having been in prison is like a tattoo on your forehead #NPCLunch"
Reform our criminal justice system...This is not a political issue; it is a leadership issue. #NPCLunch
There are people who need jobs and there is work to be do #NPCLunch
The technology revolution has pushed a lot of lower-skilled people into unemployment #NPCLunch
We  need to reconfigure the tax code so that our taxes fall in a fair way #NPCLunch
I would agree that we cannot tax ourselves into prosperity#NPCLunch
Our workers \u2013 the most productive work force in the world \u2013 have been the ones left behind #NPCLunch
When I graduated from the Naval Academy the average corporate CEO made 20 times the average worker\u2019s pay.  Now it\u2019s closer to 350 #NPCLunch
The growth of our economy has been increasingly reflected in capital gains rather than in the salaries of our working people #NPCLunch
"Stock market nearly tripled, from 6443 in '09 to 17,000 today.  At same time, income levels among working people suffered a steady decline"
Give our people some hope in issues of economic fairness and social justice. #NPCLunch
No such thing as the right of any President to unilaterally decide to use force in combat operations based on \u201chumanitarian intervention.\u201d
DO NOT OCCUPY TERRITORY...We already have terrain to defend \u2013 the United States and our outposts overseas #NPCLunch
Neither the United Nations nor NATO has the power to bring the United States into an elective war without the consent of our Congress.
"POTUS should be able to explain the specific objectives of the operations, and the end result he or she wishes to obtain #NPCLunch"
"If POTUS wishes to conduct offensive military operations, he-or-she\u2013 should be able to explain clearly the threat to national security"
"In Japan, American occupation forces quickly became 50,000 friends. In Iraq, they would quickly become 50,000 terrorist targets #NPCLunch"
It is not a healthy thing when the world\u2019s dominant military and economic power has a policy based on vagueness #NPCLunch
Our foreign policy has become a tangled mess of what can only be called situational ethics #NPCLunch
An understandable statement of our national security interests is the basis of any great nation\u2019s foreign policy #NPCLunch
We must develop a clear statement of national security and foreign policy #NPCLunch
"Every one of us should view it as our duty, if nothing else, to participate in the national discussion #NPCLunch"
True fairness is not an impossible dream #NPCLunch
"Despite barriers that divided us politically, I\u2019m na\xefve enough to believe we can come together to repair the fabric of our national spirit"
Erect standards of fairness when it comes to the opportunity to succeed.  Don\u2019t pick favorites based on special access to power #NPCLunch
"Maintain order and public safety \u2013 for all, whether you\u2019re in East Baltimore or North Arlington. #NPCLunch"
What are the responsibilities of our government?  Here\u2019s a list.  Provide for the common defense.  Promote the general welfare. #NPCLunch
"Did we fail as the greatest nation descended slowly\u2026into mediocrity because of bad choices, petty debates, and trivial party politics"
The greatest military power on earth has lacked a clearly defined set of principles that would communicate our national security objectives
"For more than two decades, since the end of the Cold War, our country has been adrift in its foreign policy. #NPCLunch"
This societal dislocation is happening at a time when America\u2019s place on the international stage has become increasingly unclear #NPCLunch
How can we say we are fellow Americans when tens of millions of people are being quietly written off #NPCLunch
The very character of America is being called into question.  Who are we as a people? #NPCLunch
"We seldom know when we are living through a period of truly historic challenge; we only know, after it\u2019s over, that we did #NPCLunch"

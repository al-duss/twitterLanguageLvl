Just watched the Super Bowl Halftime Show on TV. I think it's one of the best produced shows ever. Big ups to all that worked so hard on it.
Tonight's HIMYM episode was crazy to film. Just know: all three acts are exactly the same length. It'll make sense after you see it.
"At last: a brand new episode of HIMYM is on tonight! It's a 'structure' episode, one of my favorite kinds. Hopey you likey."
"I really dug the halftime show. Not sure how it looked on TV, but all the production and projections combined with Madonna rocking? Loved."
"Oh, and I finally ate at @stelmo! So happy I couldn't stop crying. Partly because we got a table, mostly from the spicy shrimp cocktail."

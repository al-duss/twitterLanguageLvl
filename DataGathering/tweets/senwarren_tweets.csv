There's no other way to say it: #Trumpcare is just part of a GOP plan to help the rich get richer &amp; kick dirt in everyone else's face.

Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for bringing Coretta Scott King\u2019s words back to the US Senate. https://t.co/YLn8MWBQD2
Tonight @SenateMajLdr silenced Mrs King's voice on the Sen floor - &amp; millions who are afraid &amp; appalled by what's happening in our country.
I will not be silent while the Republicans rubber stamp an AG who will never stand up to the @POTUS when he breaks the law.
I will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory &amp; racist comments that have no place in our justice system.
I spoke out about @SenatorSessions \u2013 until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me. https://t.co/qbty7x0iLl
"On the floor, I read a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing @SenatorSessions's judicial nomination: https://t.co/mnACXekh8f"

"The Wall St bankers may be popping champagne, but Americans haven't forgotten the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 and they won't forget today."

".@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St during his campaign \u2013 but as @POTUS, we're finding out whose side he's really on."
Tonight I urged my Senate colleagues to vote no on this morally bankrupt giveaway to @exxonmobil: https://t.co/1vcJ8b3w5u

"This morning, the @SenateGOP unilaterally changed the committee rules to ram through Price &amp; Mnuchin without a single Democrat present."
".@SenateDems insisted: no vote on these nominees until we bring them back in to explain why they lied. Perfectly reasonable, right?"

It\u2019s time for the Senate to stand up for the Constitution &amp; exert moral leadership. I urge my colleagues: Vote NO on Jeff Sessions for AG.
Jeff Sessions is so dangerous that a Republican-controlled Senate rejected his nomination to a federal judgeship 30 years ago.
"Trump expects us to replace the AG w/ Jeff Sessions, whose career is defined by hostility to civil rights, immigrants &amp; the rule of law."
"Let me repeat: the @POTUS fired the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer for refusing to defend an illegal, unconstitutional, immoral order."
"Last night, the acting AG refused to defend @realDonaldTrump\u2019s unlawful &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban, so Trump fired her."

I urge my colleagues: vote NO on Steve Mnuchin. Don\u2019t put the fates of the families you represent in the hands of a lying Wall St insider.
Steve Mnuchin won't give us an honest answer about his foreclosure record. He's not going to give us one when we give him our economy.

"On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember what can happen when hatred &amp; fear turns neighbor against neighbor. When we abandon those in need."
Turning our back on refugees because of their religion creates recruiting fodder for ISIS and other terrorist groups.
"The Syrian refugees admitted to the US last yr are kids, doctors, teachers, engineers, &amp; college students who sought safety from terrorists."
"We are a country of immigrants &amp; refugees, of people fleeing religious persecution &amp; seeking freedom, a country made strong by diversity."
.@realDonaldTrump's order restricting immigrants from Muslim countries &amp; freezing admission of refugees is a betrayal of American values.
Let\u2019s be clear: A Muslim ban by any other name is still a Muslim ban.

Betsy DeVos repeatedly demonstrated contempt for public ed. She plans to maintain financial ties that could create conflicts of interest.

Watch my questioning of @WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf &amp; his gutless leadership at today\u2019s @SenateBanking hearing: https://t.co/5brb1AAgz4
".@WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf should resign, give back the money he took while the scam was going on, &amp; be criminally investigated."
"A bank cashier who steals $20 would be facing theft charges, but Wall St execs never hold themselves accountable. Not in 2008 &amp; not now."
"We know @WellsFargo\u2019s Board knew of exec Carrie Tolstedt\u2019s misconduct, but she\u2019ll still retire with a huge payout: https://t.co/leTA3jL4we"
We know @WellsFargo is proud of cross-selling - getting customers to open more accounts. See the earnings calls: https://t.co/gPflL7JtkL
.@WellsFargo\u2019s definition of \u201caccountable\u201d is to push blame on low-level employees who don\u2019t have money or PR firms to defend themselves.
"The @CFPB caught @WellsFargo in a massive, years-long scam. CEO John Stumpf hasn\u2019t resigned. He hasn\u2019t fired 1 senior executive."
Today at 10am @SenateBanking will question @WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf about its years-long scam. Watch: https://t.co/EG5ZjTAP7j
I agree with @SenMarkey \u2013 it's time to #UnlockTheBox. https://t.co/RxvFH4nyB6
Watch my speech on our bill to make sure every Presidential candidate releases their taxes \u2013 even @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/hCCRK0ZUtk
.@realDonaldTrump won't release his taxes voluntarily. Let's pass the Presidential Tax Transparency Act and make sure he comes clean.
We don't know what @realDonaldTrump is hiding in his taxes. What new tax scams he's running. Which foreign dictators have him on the take.
Every major party Presidential candidate should release their tax returns. And they all do \u2013 except @realDonaldTrump. He's just too chicken.
"Thanks, FCIC Chair @PhilAngelides. I agree: This wasn't ""immaculate corruption"" - DOJ's failure defies common sense. https://t.co/W9MOrTjfWw"
The @FBI released @HillaryClinton\u2019s info citing \u201cintense public interest.\u201d It should do the same for its Wall Street FCIC investigations.
I\u2019ve also asked the @FBI to release its investigation materials related to FCIC referrals. https://t.co/iicSLZ2Wwf https://t.co/rvt4JF8frd
I've asked @TheJusticeDept to investigate its inability to prosecute the FCIC's referrals. https://t.co/iicSLZ2Wwf https://t.co/oVNl7ghEx3
Not one of the people or corporations referred to @TheJusticeDept by the FCIC has been criminally prosecuted. That\u2019s an abysmal failure.
The FCIC investigated the causes of the 2008 crisis. Recently-released docs show they referred 9 people &amp; 14 corps to @TheJusticeDept.
"8 years ago today, Lehman Bros filed for bankruptcy. The big banks recklessly gambled with our economy &amp; millions of people suffered for it."
"Rep @LamarSmithTX21\u2019s big oil buddies don\u2019t want state AGs to do their jobs, but the AGs aren\u2019t going to cower to big oil or the GOP."
"You don\u2019t need a hearing to know basic facts, @LamarSmithTX21: the US Constitution gives states power to enforce state laws."
Sci Chairman @LamarSmithTX21 held a hearing today on his unprecedented step of subpoenaing state AGs for investigating @exxonmobil.
"The American people pay us to get things done, @SenateGOP. With this schedule, I\u2019d want my money back. #DoYourJob https://t.co/XiZoYvht6O"

Read my letter to Aetna requesting answers about its Humana merger &amp; #Obamacare-related decisions. https://t.co/p4cvzbiB1A
Aetna\u2019s decision to use the health of millions of Americans as a bargaining chip for its Humana merger is inexplicable &amp; irresponsible.
Read my @nytimes op-ed about how Congress should fix our broken corporate tax code: https://t.co/SsUA4SfYOz
"When tax dodgers move back to the US, they should pay their fair share \u2013 just as working families &amp; small businesses have been all along."
"Now that other leading countries are starting to get tough on tax enforcement, corporate tax dodgers want to move money back to the US."
Corporate tax dodgers have taken full advantage of the benefits of being a US company while searching for every way to avoid paying taxes.
"We need MORE transparency &amp; accountability in shadow banking, not less. @HouseDemocrats: stand up to Wall St lobbyists &amp; oppose HR 5424."
"One @HouseGOP bill being pushed this week, HR 5424, would let private equity &amp; hedge funds disclose even LESS info to federal regulators."
1st order of business for @HouseGOP after a 7-wk recess? Not Zika. Not LA flooding. Just a pile of bills to weaken the rules on Wall Street.
All we\u2019re asking is for the @SenateGOP to stop playing politics with judicial nominees and #DoYourJob. This is disgraceful.
Today I called on the @SenateGOP to consider 10 nominees already passed through Judiciary. They said no. https://t.co/6u3LeFmH4y #DoYourJob
The @SenateGOP have made it very clear: They want @realDonaldTrump to appoint judges who will bend the law for their interests. #DoYourJob
Today there are more than twice as many judicial vacancies &amp; emergencies as there were at this point in the Bush Admin. #DoYourJob
The @SenateGOP are setting new records for obstruction with judicial nominations \u2013 leaving courts overburdened &amp; understaffed. #DoYourJob

Now it\u2019s time to focus on helping @ITTTech students \u2013 the real victims \u2013 get their loans cancelled or finish programs at schools that care.
.@usedgov took the right step a few weeks ago when they banned @ITTTech from enrolling new students with federal student loan money.
The only people responsible for @ITTTech\u2019s collapse are their execs who sucked students in with thousands in debt &amp; useless degrees.
"#Zika funding isn\u2019t a place for your selfish, partisan games, @SenateGOP. People\u2019s lives are at risk. Bring a clean bill to a vote NOW."
"After a 7-wk @GOP recess, the @SenateGOP's 1st priority is the same old #Zika bill that hurts women, vets, Obamacare, @PPFA &amp; clean water."
19 of my @SenateDems colleagues &amp; I sent a letter to Mylan for answers about the EpiPen price hike: https://t.co/Q3q1yTinBN
Mylan\u2019s promise of a new generic EpiPen for half the price only further calls into question the excessive price of branded EpiPens.
"Mylan\u2019s expanded patient assistance programs are an industry game to keep EpiPen costs high for insurance companies, the gov &amp; employers."
I have serious concerns about pharmaceutical giant Mylan\u2019s significant price hikes for the life-saving EpiPen Auto-Injector.
.@ITTTech's free ride is finally over &amp; the message is clear: We won't stand by &amp; allow these shady schools to cheat students &amp; taxpayers.
"Today, @usedgov has finally said enough is enough, banning @ITTTech from enrolling any new students with federal dollars this fall."
"The SEC, @CFPB, &amp; @MassAGO are all suing @ITTTech for fraud &amp; they failed, again, to meet the low standards of their accrediting agency."
".@ITTTech \u2013 a massive, for-profit college \u2013 is currently under investigation by 20 state &amp; federal agencies for cheating students."
Great news: @TheJusticeDept will end its use of ineffective &amp; dangerous private prisons - 1 step to fix our broken criminal justice system.
.@HUDgov guidance will send a clear message that housing-related ordinances must protect vulnerable individuals \u2013 not leave them homeless.

I'll keep pushing our federal agencies to reschedule marijuana as part of crafting a rational research &amp; public health strategy.
"Bad news: @DEAHQ refused to reschedule marijuana. This has wide implications for med research, law enforcement &amp; business."
Good news: @DEAHQ is eliminating outdated barriers to marijuana research. Common sense given growing pool of med marijuana patients.

"Big corporations must disclose lobbying expenditures, but not contributions to think tanks to fund industry-friendly studies. That\u2019s wrong."
"Want to protect open debate, Mr Koch? Disclose the spending you do to bury your opponents in an avalanche of lies: https://t.co/lF703sf4Hw"
"Charles Koch, who secretly spends millions to shred candidates and orgs he opposes, is worried that open debate is under attack. Really?!"
.@HouseGOP time &amp; again puts Big Oil interests over every other issue. Proud to stand w/ @MassAGO. Let her investigate &amp; see the facts.
Every MA delegation member signed a letter to @LamarSmithTX21 w/ concerns about this disgraceful pander to Big Oil. https://t.co/fUl9DZ1liu
GOP says @MassAGO\u2019s investigation is a war on 1st Amendment rights. But companies don\u2019t have a right to defraud their investors &amp; consumers.
We haven't found another example \u2013 not one \u2013 of a House committee subpoenaing a STATE AG's investigation of potential STATE law violations.
"The @HouseGOP claims to be for states\u2019 rights, but they don\u2019t seem to know the Constitution gives STATES power to enforce STATE law."
Sci Chairman @LamarSmithTX21 issued subpoenas to @MassAGO Healey &amp; @AGSchneiderman\u2014 a prime example of @HouseGOP abuse of power.
The GOP-led @HouseScience Committee is helping @exxonmobil deny the reality of climate change.
Today in the @NEJM I write about the need for transparency in our clinical trial system to improve people's health: https://t.co/l6hBWp53Hk
Yesterday @MassAGO took an important step to stop the spread of lethal assault-style weapons. Read more here: https://t.co/ElPNcmPTf5
"Let me offer you a word of advice, @LamarSmithTX21 &amp; your @exxonmobil buddies: you picked a fight with the wrong state &amp; the wrong AG."
This is an outrageous abuse of Congressional subpoena power to threaten a state AG and help a campaign contributor.
"For the @GOP, states\u2019 rights only apply for restricting voting rights or regulating women\u2019s bodies. Not investigating climate change fraud."
.@LamarSmithTX21 says he \u201ctakes very seriously his obligation to uphold &amp; defend the Constitution\u201d \u2014 but apparently not the 10th Amendment.
"Yup, that\u2019s right: House Republicans are interfering with a state AG\u2019s ongoing investigation of a company violating state law."
Now @exxonmobil got the Chair of the @HouseScience Committee \u2014 a TX Republican who has taken $675k from oil &amp; gas \u2014 to subpoena @MassAGO.
First @exxonmobil tried to stop @MassAGO by suing Healey in a TX court &amp; attacking her integrity because she\u2019s doing her job.
.@MassAGO Maura Healey is investigating whether @exxonmobil broke state laws by knowingly misleading people about climate change.
Want to see how giant corporations rig the system? Look at what @exxonmobil is doing to intimidate @MassAGO to stop fraud investigation.
Heartsick for the families of the Baton Rouge police officers killed today. More violence &amp; bloodshed won't fix the pain in our country.
The @CFPB is proof that government CAN work for the people. #ConsumersCount https://t.co/kAUI4UG4pS
"We need our gov agencies to work together to warn students, veterans &amp; families about other unlicensed \u201cuniversities\u201d like Trump \u201cU.\u201d"

"Trump U violated NY law by calling itself a ""university"" without a charter or license. Vulnerable people lost big bucks to Trump's scheme."
The @HouseGOP should be ashamed. The last thing Congress should be doing is giving homophobic Americans a license to discriminate.
"The GOP #FADA bill could let hospitals, government workers, employers, &amp; even landlords discriminate against married same-sex couples."
Marriage equality is the law of the land. But #LGBT Americans still lack federal protections against discrimination they desperately need.
I\u2019m not joking: @HouseGOP are holding a hearing right now about making it easier for people to discriminate against #LGBT Americans.
Our country has seen too many tragedies this month. So what are the @HouseGOP doing right now? Holding a hearing to legalize hate.
"I wish I had the answers right now to stop the very real pain that people are feeling, but I know this: change must come. It must come now."
I'm sick at heart about those who would pull us apart at exactly the moment when we need to come together.
I\u2019m sick at heart for the families of the officers killed in Dallas. Sick at heart for the families of the men shot in LA &amp; MN.
"Black Americans shouldn't be killed in routine traffic stops, &amp; police shouldn't be killed while protecting &amp; serving their communities."
"No. No. No. No. No. More killing solves nothing. More grieving moms &amp; dads, sons &amp; daughters cannot bring back those we\u2019ve already  lost."
#blacklivesmatter must be more than a hashtag or trending topic every time a tragedy happens. We must all come together to make it true.
We can't ignore the ugly reality: black parents are terrified that teaching kids to \u201csurvive\u201d the police won't be enough. #blacklivesmatter
Most cops are good ppl. But we can\u2019t ignore the ugly reality: black parents feel they must teach kids to \u201csurvive\u201d police. #blacklivesmatter

"Every day @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP don't take #Zika seriously, more ppl get sick. 481 pregnant women in US states &amp; territories have Zika NOW."
"Is this some sort of sick joke, @SenateGOP? Is the #Zika virus \u2014 and our country\u2019s response to this emergency \u2014 just a game to you?!"
"I didn\u2019t think the GOP could write 1 bill to hurt women, vets, Obamacare, PP, AND clean water all at once \u2013 but they did it. #Zika"
The GOP #Zika bill cuts Senate levels of @DeptVetAffairs funding by $500M \u2013 money for VA hospital maintenance &amp; raises for doctors &amp; nurses.
The GOP #Zika bill rolls back Clean Water Act requirements designed to keep pesticides out of Americans\u2019 drinking water.
The GOP #Zika bill blocks @PPFA from receiving birth control grant money that would help poor women with Zika avoid having deformed babies.
The GOP #Zika bill guts money from healthcare exchanges in the Affordable Care Act (#obamacare) to pay for the emergency response.
"The GOP #Zika bill steals money from the #Ebola response fund, even though we still have 75 CDC staff on ground fighting the outbreak."
The GOP #Zika bill provides $800 million less in funding than the @WhiteHouse requested. Money we need for prevention &amp; treatment.
"Then while @HouseDemocrats fought for gun violence votes at #NoBillNoBreak, the @HouseGOP jammed through a terrible #Zika bill at 3am."
"4 months ago, the @WhiteHouse requested $1.9B to fight #Zika. Dems asked the GOP to act \u2013 and the GOP dragged their feet."
"My blood is boiling over the pathetic, dishonest &amp; malicious #Zika funding bill that @SenateMajLdr McConnell &amp; the GOP just tried to pass."

A marriage between @realDonaldTrump\u2019s toxic racism &amp; @RepHensarling\u2019s Wall Street giveaways is a path to ruin for our country.

The proposed payday lending rule isn\u2019t perfect \u2013 it could do more \u2013 but the payday industry is already firing back.

"Today, our top regulators warned us about the danger of the biggest banks. We would be foolish to ignore their warnings."
This is a giant warning sign of the central role big banks will play in the next crisis unless Congress &amp; regulators show some backbone.
"No execs lost their jobs in exchange for taxpayer rescue. None went to jail. Some, like Jamie Dimon, are still running the same banks."
"Big bank execs got rich but when it all predictably blew up, the gov lavished their institutions with billions in bailouts."
The big banks spread risk throughout the system by misleading investors about the quality of mortgages in the securities they were offering.

The Tax Filing Simplification Act is a commonsense bill to push the IRS to simplify Tax Day. Learn more: https://t.co/knv4GUBu8G
And the Tax Filing Simplification Act provides a return-free option for those with simple tax situations.
The Tax Filing Simplification Act lets taxpayers download third-party-reported tax information that the IRS already has.
It prohibits the IRS from entering into agreements w/ tax prep companies that restrict its ability to provide free online services.
"My bill directs the IRS to develop a free, online tax prep &amp; filing service that taxpayers can use directly w/ the gov."
Today I introduced the Tax Filing Simplification Act to help taxpayers file with less stress &amp; fewer costs.
"Congress should be making it easier for Americans to file their taxes, not bowing to the interests of the tax prep industry."
"This year, taxpayers will spend an average of 13 hrs prepping taxes &amp; pay $200 for tax prep services."
Read my office\u2019s new report on how the IRS caved to powerful companies w/ a vested interest in complicated taxes: https://t.co/wXXrLh60T7

"You\u2019d think big banks would be happy with enforcement so tepid that they could just bake fines into the cost of doing business, right?"

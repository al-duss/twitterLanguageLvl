@Meljo1969 Pleasure all bound up with guilt. Massage feels like undeserved pleasure. Unless it hurts. Then it's great.
"@ThatDurre Well quite. Once you've discounted the therapeutic angle, you're left with nice, which is never nice."
Same used to be true of men's after shave. They put alcohol in to make it sting like hell so men could feel better about wearing perfume.
I wonder if the notion of knots and tension has been invented to give a remedial respectability to something that is just plain nice?
Have you ever been told by a masseur that you have no knots? No signs of tension whatsoever? Me neither. I smell a rat.
There's one called Blossom in Winnipeg but sounds fishy. So I laid shoes on the floor and  rolled over them for a few minutes. Good as new.

Of course the crow may be telling his friends that a huge bald git just stared at him through a window. Maybe they're giving him brandy.
What if it was Paul Dacre doing a spot of weekend shape-shifting?

I just read that back and it seems to be screaming Go To Bed.
"What footling creatures we are, swanking about observing what footling creatures we are, thereby hoping that we're not.  When we are."
"A good night. John Lloyd on twinkling form, Julian Rhind-Tutt splendid and, best of all, Miriam Margoyles. Your hero was flaky."
Which is a pretty good metaphor for plastic surgery itself.
Braced for the trauma of seeing the Art Deco jewel of Broadcasting House now refitted in the style of a plastic surgery clinic.
"Off to the BBC to read stories for John Lloyd's Christmas radio show.  Putting myself in a wintry, hand-knitted frame of mind."
Another gorgeous day. The only cloud is the newspaper I have just read. Perhaps that's how it should be.

"I am, however, allowed to invade Texas."
Couple of corrections: March 2nd not 1st; and apparently the KoB's writ doesn't extend to airlines.
"Anyway, you are all invited. Tell the airline I said it was ok. March 1st."

"@IdiotaIngles I'd rather not say. He's entitled to his privacy. If he joins twitter and tells you, that's his business."
"@AmiCausa But we are part of wolves' environment, as they are part of ours. Maybe they have triumphed by becoming dogs, as we became human."
Many humans have chosen to die on their feet than live on their knees. Many more haven't. The rest of us are lucky not to face the choice.
@DeusExJuice Quite right.  I was just questioning the idea that it's better to be noble and non-existent.
@LisaAchacon I chose labrador because that's how I heard the factoid. Labs similar size to coyote. My dog's breed is his own affair.
"Only way to tell coyote tracks from labrador is coyote's are dead straight, strictly business. Labradors frolic.  Frolicking is good."
Which is not an argument for submission over assertiveness.  Just that it's hard for any animal to be free and splendid if it doesn't exist.
"Also a triumph of cooperation over aggression. Wolves now sadly endangered at c 100,000 v 1 bn dogs.  Tail wagging beats snarling."
"Apart from the obvious stuff, a dog also opens the door on the whole animal kingdom. Birds, ants, giraffes, all become more legible."
"What a privilege it is to have the care of a dog. Cats too, perhaps, I don't know. Chain of command less clear with  cats."
"They might not be Scandinavian either, but they're definitely jolly. So is the audience. Hooting with laughter. I can't immediately see why."
Maybe I imagined the mustard yellow.
A search for modern masters of boogie woogie piano yields countless jolly Scandinavians in mustard yellow jackets. Why might this be?

"Dick Gregory also reason enough to rethink Hugh Hefner.  Ha ha what a mad old goat.  Well no.  Much, much more than that."
Now resolved to watch RP Live in Concert again as soon as possible.  Also anything of Dick Gregory.  Titans.
It's called Furious Cool and it's both those things.
Reading and LOVING Joe &amp; David Henry's bio of Richard Pryor.  Beautiful portrait of RP but also of the mountains he set himself to climb.

Proud of the dog. He just completed a 2 hour walk while dangling the same 9 inch rope of slobber from his jowl. You try it.

"@TheFirstChibi When in doubt, go with the closest noun."
"Obviously I have never seen YOUR sister. I meant one's sister, but ""one's"" seems out of place in twitspeak."
Perhaps a new democracy will accompany HD. We once gazed up at silvery giants. Now all movie stars look like your sister after a hot bath.
@Anonymously4844 Everything.  Trying to catch up on 10 yrs of British TV in one night.  I'm almost there. Just 30 more comedy panel shows.
"I predict a new kind of facial aesthetic. Symmetry and cheekbones, having dominated for millennia, will lose out to boiled egg complexions."
"It's a hopeless quest. The miracle of the brain is its ability to sift, prioritise, ignore. We don't need or want to see pores."
I just can't love HD. Definition is of surfaces rather than shapes. All ear hair and pimples. Everyone looks like they've just been slapped.
Shutting down now. Jet lag and vodka do not make for good tweetage.
"@tracyhepburnfan that's not a goatee, just a badly poured beard."
American men over 35 yrs and 250lbs wear goatees. It signifies individuality.

@WWE_JCena oh it's lupus alright
"The males have beards, of course, but they're goatees. Understandably. But makes me think of reality TV shows concerning guns and trucks."
I never knew a goat well enough to form an opinion on his or her intellect.

Already sinking back into the bosom of the motherland. It's good to leave England for a while just to appreciate how beautiful it is.
"I hope the people who do the tables, seats, screens on aeroplanes don't also do the wings. Must be a different outfit, surely?"
"Back in cold, wet London. Men with grey cheeks, women with red noses. Feels wonderful."
@_M_H_M_ I don't know the instance you mean but I apologise  for it and yes.
@Elizabeth_Malet A mysterious stranger will come from the east.  Possibly on a scooter.
I retract 'wading through' - exactly the sort of casual snidery I so dislike in newspapers - and substitute 'reading'. I was reading offal.
"At the airport, wading through English newspapers without any clear purpose or benefit. Might have to shower before getting on the plane."
Cravats are different. I always assume they're concealing auto-erotic strangulation marks.
"I'm not saying bow-ties aren't cool. Just that you need to have a Subject.  Modern art, butterflies, antiques, ear infections. Something."
Bow-ties I'm less sure about.  Maybe because I'm a jack of all trades and bow-ties are for masters of one.
Hatlelujah was very poor. I apologise.
Also the centre of the hat universe. It's actually possible to wear a hat unironically in New Orleans. Hatlelujah.
Every corner oozes playing and singing of an amazing sweetness. 5 bucks in a bucket gets you better sounds than you'll hear anywhere else.
A stroll round NO has congealed some of the wax after last night's fall. Although the buskers can make you never touch an instrument again.
@JRhodesPianist thank you for giving any credence to this rumour.  my playing lays heavy emphasis on the pathetique...
"Icarus, that's me. The players last night were so hot, I got into a waxy, falling mess. But we raised money, and Fess's daughter was lovely."
"A parade just marched past my window. Don't know what for. Someone died, someone was born, someone bought some new socks?"
The musicians are immense and i'm lucky to be breathing the same air. But I patted Fess's bronze head and asked for his blessing. We'll see.
"Just finished rehearsal for tomorrow's show at Tip's. Ears ringing, heart pounding, hands shaking. On Fess's stage with the high priests."
A Mississippi giant... http://t.co/Aqs0EkZLgz
If truckers are the toiling Nibelungen - which they aren't - then Fasolt and Fafner are lumbering up the river. How d'you like them apples?
"Train in the distance, maybe headed for Baton Rouge or Lafayette. Its whistle had an extra note. 1-5-7. Or am I just an old fool?"
"Just saw The Milk Carton Kids. A sublime confusion of Simon+Garfunkel, the Everly Brothers, Gilbert+George, Penn+Teller... Stunningly great."

I'm headed for NOLA and the terrifying honour of a Fess charity event at Tipitina's. Food won't taste right until this bridge is crossed.
Lusty and well-oiled crowd for the last show in Atlanta. Now the CBB retires to their cryogenic pods until 2014. Sweet sorrow.
Confusion here.  Sorry.  Mine are notional questions we ought to be able to ask of nations.
"""Question 73.8.  Do your police officers wear sunglasses and chew gum?"""
"""Question 19.4. Describe chemical trace elements in your drinking water."""
"""Please include details of all previous convictions for corruption, warmongering and human rights violations."""
"I mean really. Why not this way round? ""I'm considering your country as a recipient of my time and effort - describe why you might qualify?"""
Quiet study time while the band fill in their visa forms for the next leg. General derision at the impertinence of government bureaucracy.
Last toe of this leg in Atlanta GA before the CBB scatters for a few months. Keen to finish on a high.  Possibly even a good-humoured riot.
"Being English, I was born without hips, but I tried to honour the event with some racy nostril-flaring."
"The Florida Theatre was where Elvis performed in 1956 before a judge, who had to rule on the suggestiveness of the King's hip movements."
Jacksonville FL my new favourite city. Rollicking crowd keen to put the football result behind them. We sucked the encore barrel dry.
Calm before the storm. In 30 minutes I cry 'havoc!' and then we'll see if anyone knows what I'm on about.
"And I survey the hive with a benign smile, fanning myself with my hat. I have delicate hands, you see."
"Crew just got in from Atlanta. Frayed but in good spirits. Now madly rigging, cabling, plugging. Normal service has been resumed."
"Heroic work from local crew. We'll be ready 8pm. Florida theatre Jacksonville. Don't miss it! Because, you know. You can't unmiss it later."
Streets filling with Gators and Bulldogs faithful. It's a hajj. Which is probably offensive but shouldn't be.
"Met 3 lads at a cafe. They played me some rap, I asked them to the show - warned them it's really old music. They said like 70s rock?"
Another stunning building. 1926 a good year for theatres. US still speckled with these gems that have somehow escaped thuggish developers.
"Band has got to Jacksonville, crew still stranded. We will now electrocute ourselves trying to rig our own gear. Brown is earth, right?"
"Truck stop in  South Carolina. Ranks of trucking elves bringing your breakfast, clothes, books, toys. All have goatees."
You still shouldn't miss it.
"Crew bus has broken down. If they're not rolling in the next few hours, Jacksonville show will be sock puppets followed by Q and A."
"Florida Theater in Jacksonville FL tomorrow night. Don't miss it - because if you do, you'll miss it. And you don't want that. To miss it."
Thumping good show to a crowd of lively North Carolinians. I danced like a man falling down stairs.
I'm an hourglass half full sort of person.
"Hair disappearing from my head like sand from an hourglass.  Although not growing out of my feet, which is a relief."
"Carolina Theatre in Durham NC, a beautiful 1920s temple of culture and amusement. What is a town without a place like this at its centre?"
"So how do you do? all over again. I will try to serve only the freshest, tenderest morsels, moist with the morning dew. Your servant etc"
"I peel away the mask of jlumbrozo to reveal the Phantom.  The scoundrel I thought had bagged hughlaurie was actually me, years ago. Oops."
"Swampy drizzle in North Carolina. Raindrops seem to fall slower here than up north, meandering down with their ties loosened.  Nice."
"A night of ribs, beer, pool and shuffleboard.  Oh, how I strongly disapprove of myself."
Durham North Carolina. Nice autumnal palette laid on by this God fellow I keep hearing so much about.
I offered my hand to a 10 yr old girl and she shunned it. Doesn't shake hands with men. Her parents beamed like she'd just spoken Latin.
"No fights, no sarcasm.  Great audience and great sound. Although...."
Beautiful theatre in Keswick PA.  Lovely vibe to the place and people. Could signify a great show or fist fights and sarcasm. The unknown.
Truck drivers are a noble breed. Toiling through the night to bring Christmas every morning. Might try for a licence when this is over.
"6 am at a truck stop in Trenton NJ, my fictional home for the last 10 years.  A new moon grinning through clouds.  No meaning, just facts."
"Boston audience fantastic. We were good too, but the audience were better. Knowledgeable, appreciative. Also handsome and stylishly dressed."
"In Boston now, polishing brass before tonights's show. The vegans have gone out scavenging. Carnivores asleep."
"Welcome, in other words.  I will strive to be worthy, to protect and defend etc"
"Yikes.  As Sinatra liked to say ""how'd all these people get in my room?"" If I'd known, I would have baked a cake."
"Perhaps a H of S, with attendant intelligence apparatus, is fairer game than man waiting for the Clapham omnibus?  Not sure if that's it."
Years of horror at encroaching government survelliance - and now I can't muster any outrage at the tapping of Angela M's phone.  Why?
When a paper cup is that hot you know the coffee must be gibberish.  Do grounds dissipate heat quicker?
Wait - the coffee's meaningless.
On a train NY to Boston in glorious sunshine. Can't find a single thing to moan about. I'm losing my touch.
Lovely time with Jimmy Fallon where I declared my Twittish bona fides. Next to Celine Dion on the sofa.  What is going on in this world??
"Perfect Day it was. A much more beautiful song than my rendition of it, but perfect for an Imperfect Day. Lou Reed RIP."
"Calvin Theatre Northampton, wrestling with whether to do a Lou Reed song to mark his passing. The only official fan club I ever belonged to."
"Which is the greater pleasure?  The triumphant capture of a photograph, or the contemplation of it a year later?"
"In Springfield Mass., on our way to sound check. I feel like doing 6 new songs tonight, terrifying myself and everyone else. It'll pass."
"Our appetite for photos. Are we trying to hold back time? Sandbags against the flood? Or are we all NSA, doing it just because we can?"
"We grieve for earthquake victims a continent away, but not a century away. Are we programmed to stop once the natural lifespan has elapsed?"
"The English inventor of The Mighty Wurlitzer organ, Robert Hope-Jones, committed suicide in 1914. No less sad than if it happened yesterday."
"Good show at Tonowonda Riviera, one of the prettiest theatres in the land, with a fully restored 1926 Wurlitzer organ. How could I resist?"
And so great to see m'col on fine form. Wish I could have seen 12th Night but apparently not much changed from London. If it ain't broke..
"300 miles west to Buffalo, still reeling from last night's audience in NY.  A fine collection of humanity under one roof."
Drink with m'col at the Algonquin. We were so witty we could hardly understand each other. Then a rollicking good show.  What a city.
M'colleague and I performing tonight in adjacent theatres in NY. It's a funny old world.  Compared to some of the others I've visited.
"Just played some songs with Gaby at a bar in NYC. She sang like an angel. I played like Goebbels. But Vincent, Liz and Jean made me proud."
Birchmere went well. Hard to rouse people because of tables but we got there in the end.  There was a dog in the front row who loved it.
Sound checked and double checked.  Audience at the Birchmere is so close they're almost behind us.  I shouldn't have eaten that onion.
Lovely gaggle of fans at the Birchmere. Though I'm superstitious meeting people before a show. Like seeing the bride before the wedding.
"Practicing in hotel room on electro keyboard.  But no headphones, so I can't hear what I'm doing. Ideal."
"Alexandria impossibly pretty.  Dainty colonial style, shops selling frilly scented things.  My feet feel enormous."
"600 miles south to Alexandria VA, much of it to the strains of The Last Waltz.  By God but The Band were good. Dr J's Such A Night sublime."
"Well I'll be. Monty audience looked so stern and classical, but they cut loose!  The CBB's playing has reached dizzying heights.  Thin air."
We've stormed the Maison Symphonique in Montreal. Dressing rooms bigger than some venues we've played. Hope we can lower the tone tonight.
"Nice interviewer for CBC seemed to think I had been to Montreal before, for a golf tournament. I have instructed my lawyers."
Actually not dead but in Montreal.  Which is a very different ball of wax.
Woke up on empty bus parked in a vast yellow hangar with no doors or windows.  Assumed I was dead. Trippy but not unpleasant.
Toronto unable to resist our potent mix of herbs and spices. A thumping good show. The bus has to break down now.  It's all too good...
Danforth Music Hall Toronto.  The quiet murmur of preparation before battle is joined.  I might do something from Henry V.
Didn't mean to insult Toronto by implying it doesn't have a lively and compelling gang problem too. Must get out more.
"Day dawns bright over typical Toronto scene. Drunks, pimps, hookers. hustlers, bikers, beggars, bootleggers. Not a single one in sight."
Breathing Canadian air now. Minty fresh with a hint of health care. Might get a new hip while I'm here.
What a life. Someone nicer ought to be living it.
"On the bus now, eating spicy chicken wings and watching Lightning in a Bottle. More angry than spicy. Probably cross into Canada around 5."
Lovely crowd in Kent and we gave as good as we got.  This band can get a song quivering 10 feet off the floor and they did it tonight.
Last occupant of this dressing room was Kevin Costner.  The air is sweet but manly. I am going to trap some in a can for later.
Show tonight in Kent OH then bus up to Canada. Find fault with that scenario.  I can't. The road is a fine place to be.
Bowling in Cleveland. Badly. But it's one of those rare games: no one minds being bad.  Must be infuriating for those who can do it well.
"On reflection, being able to crash a stock market or cause a typhoon with a beat of their wings may be legacy enough."
"Then again, maybe butterflies dream of being pinned in someone's butterfly hall of fame?"
"Decided against HoF, fearing the reaction I had the first time I saw butterflies pinned."
"Pulled into Cleveland 2am and slept like a dead rhino.  Now deliberating visit to RnR Hall of Fame.  Inspiring, depressing or both?"
A rule is emerging even in 3 US shows.  Men who wear white trousers to the theatre aren't happy.  Cause or effect?
Carnegie Music Hall Pittsburgh - and a lovely audience.  A good night was well and truly had.  There's got to be a catch.
We're trying a new version of Jon Cleary's So Damn Good tonight.  If I can hook my belt onto Herman's groove we'll be fine.
Another great sound check. No words to describe how good this band is. I have to conceal my open-mouthed wonder or I'd be screaming all day.
Loving the half mile of Pittsburgh I've seen.  Weighty.  Bathing my temples now in asses' milk. The air tonight shall be filled with song.
"Pittsburgh.  City of steel, paint, and the Copper Bottom Band for the next 14 hours.  We plan to leave a mark."
I made a hash of Come on Baby but we gave a good account of ourselves.  Great crowd in Chicago and the band played their socks off!!
Sound check was impossibly good.  My natural superstition makes me nervous about tonight's show.  Whisky usually helps.  To battle!!
@EmM1013 I made that point too.  Five days squeezed into 3  hours.  We can live forever!
@EmM1013 I made the point as forcefully as I could. Americans not convinced.
Debate in the band over NY v Chicago pizza.  Also cricket v baseball and sunni v shia.  No clear winners yet.
@aeiiae kicking and screaming into the 19th c.  Thanks for the opposable thumbs up!
@lock_sher keep your raspberry in your holster.  As real as a north wind. Thank you for the welcome.
"In Chicago, playing at the Vic Theatre tonight, with the mighty Copper Bottom Band.  Come and dance."
"Having damned this technology as the seed of Satan, I finally succumb.  Let tyrants tremble.  And so forth."

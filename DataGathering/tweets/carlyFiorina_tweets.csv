One of the reasons I'm a conservative is I don't believe the federal gov't should do everything it can do. #EDSummit15 #Carly2016
Teachers' unions are a power structure designed to maintain the status quo for their own reasons. #EDSummit #Carly2016
Common Core has become a set of standards based on what teachers have to teach. #EDSummit #Carly2016

"I am prepared to be a President who will lead the resurgence of this great nation, here at home and around the world. #Carly2016"
I will recognize dangers w/ eyes wide open but will also embrace w/ open arms the enormous opportunities &amp; potential of these amazing times.
"And as we tragically know, those ripples can too easily land on our shores. #Carly2016 (2/2)"
"When we abandon an ally or embolden an adversary, it reverberates throughout the world. #Carly2016 (1/2)"
I am deeply proud of our extraordinary nation and grateful to be an American. #Carly2016
Margaret Thatcher once said that she was not content to manage the decline of a great nation. Neither am I. #Carly2016
It is the height of hypocrisy for @HillaryClinton to run for President as a champ. of women's rights when her record as SOS is this dismal.
"China, Russia, Iran, &amp; terrorist groups such as ISIS \u2013 these are the big human rights tests of our time. #Carly2016"
"In February 2009, she told us we couldn\u2019t let human rights get in the way of our other goals."
".@HillaryClinton likes to talk about her support of human rights, women's rights and democracy. Her actions conflict with her words."
"Once again, the gov\u2019t bureaucracy was too bloated &amp; inept to act &amp; the political classes were too complacent to stop it. #Carly2016"
The Chinese steal our intellectual property w/ impunity &amp; engage in state-sponsored cyberterrorism. #Carly2016
"We must tell China\u2014if you declare an Air Defense Identification Zone over the South China Sea, we will not recognize it. We will not comply."
We must push back against rising Chinese aggression. We should work w/ Vietnam &amp; the Philippines to improve their surveillance capabilities.
China is using their economic might to rewrite the global order. #Carly2016
Here is another truth we must see and speak and act upon. China is our rapidly rising adversary. #Carly2016
We must have the strongest military on the face of the planet &amp; everyone has to know it. #Carly2016
"When we do not stand with our allies nor confront our adversaries, our friends lose courage and our enemies press forward. #Carly2016"
This administration\u2019s blind eye to aggression has become a black eye to America. #Carly2016
"This administration has continued to build a relationship w/ our enemies. When you reward bad behavior, you get more of it. #Carly2016"
She must be prepared to challenge the status quo &amp; the way things are \u2013 whether in Washington or around the world. #Carly2016
The next President must reestablish our leadership-- she must speak with clarity &amp; act with courage. #Carly2016

Want to see my speech last night on the state of women in America? @fxnopinion has the text here--&gt; http://t.co/6hIJkjBvJg #empoweredwomen
"Let us ensure that this nation is one in which every person knows they can choose a life of dignity, purpose and meaning. #empoweredwomen"
We must aim high as a nation. We must aim high in our families and in our communities. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
"Lastly, we must tackle the webs of dependence that are trapping women today. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner"
We also need to support small businesses. Women-owned businesses are vitally important to our economy. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
"It\u2019s time for over-the-counter birth control, which will drive down prices and increase availability. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner"
"In fact, single mothers earn $19,000 dollars less per year than married mothers. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner"
We also know that reducing out-of-wedlock births is critical. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
It is especially critical for low-income women and families that we fix our broken education system. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
Let\u2019s move to a pay-for-performance meritocracy and make promoting high-achieving men and women a top priority. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
There are many things that we can and must do so that all women can truly choose their own paths. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
A feminist is a woman who lives the life she chooses. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
The Left's view of feminism is not about women. And their policies are not working for women. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
Recent studies from the NYU Child Study Center suggest that a girl's self-esteem peaks at age 9 and declines from there. #empoweredwomen
"My experience tells me that human potential is limitless. Usually, it is underutilized or worse, squandered and wasted. #empoweredwomen"

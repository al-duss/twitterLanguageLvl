"So \u201cAlpha"" Centauri is the brightest star in the constellation Centaurus. And \u201cBeta"" Pictoris is the 2nd brightest in Pictor."
"Apart from common names, stars are generally ID'ed in order of brightness within a constellation, using the Greek alphabet."
The Southern skies have the closest star system to the Sun - the famed \u201cAlpha Centauri\u201d  The 3rd brightest in the night sky.
"Earth is closest to the Sun during the Southern Hemisphere Summer. For the North, that of course coincides with our winter."
"Many big telescope in the North have twins in the South, giving astrophysicists coherent full-sky coverage of the Universe."
Just an FYI: Earth\u2019s South Magnetic Pole is actually in the North. That\u2019s why the North tip of a compass needle points there.
The center of the Milky Way \u2014 a target of study for my PhD \u2014 passes directly overhead for all middle southern latitudes.

@Stompn_Tom: Last I checked Pittsburgh is in the Northern Hemisphere &amp; has many free Penguins. // Human Penguins don\u2019t count.
"Sundials designed for the North won't work in the Southern Hemisphere. If ported there, they would reckon time backwards."
"In the North, the shadow of a sundial\u2019s gnomon sweeps clockwise. That\u2019s, in fact, what defined clockwise in the first place."
Some of us in the North are jealous that 100% of the world\u2019s population of free Penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere.
@arrowsails Yes.
"Earth is not only oblate \u2014 wider at the equator than pole-to-pole, but pear shaped \u2014 slightly wider just south of the equator"
Earth's centrifugal force at the Equator renders everybody and everything about 6% lighter than they\u2019d weigh at the poles.
"At a revolution speed of 1,700 km / hour, the equator is Earth\u2019s fastest moving part. All other latitudes move more slowly."
"I think it's cool that there's a country on the equator with the name ""Equator"". Better known in Spanish as Ecuador"
"Antarctica\u2019s subglacial Lake Vostok is a body of water, trapped in ice, that hasn\u2019t seen air in at least 15-million years."
The flag in Antarctica that ID's the South Pole has to be repositioned  every year. The glacier beneath moves continuously.
"The South Pole is covered with land: Antarctica. In the North, Santa\u2019s gotta live on an (ever-shrinking) slab of floating ice"
"At about 2800 meters above sea level, the South Pole plateau sits at an elevation almost as high as that of Mount Olympus."

"Are you a Tide weenie? I wrote an essay called ""The Tidal Force"" some years ago:  [2,000 words] http://t.co/EVUodTrfCu"
"Not only is Earth's rotation slowly slowing down, but the Moon's orbit is spiraling away from us by about 2-inches per year."
"And not to disturb anybody, but Tides cause friction between Earth's crust and the sloshing oceans, slowing down our rotation"
"The Sun's tides are only about 1/3 that of the Moon's, so even during the canceling quarter phases, some Moon-tide remains."
"During half-moons (1st &amp; 3rd quarter), the Lunar &amp; Solar tides add out of phase, partly canceling one another."
The tides during Full (and New) Moon are highest **only** because that's when the Sun's tides add directly to them.
While we're on the subject: The Moon's capacity to raise tides on Earth is no greater when Full than at any other phase.

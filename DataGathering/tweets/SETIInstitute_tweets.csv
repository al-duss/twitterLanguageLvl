"In conclusion, CEO Bill Diamond gives his opinion that we will find the evidence we seek within 30 years. #SVGives #SETITalks"
Both @MarkRShowalter and @fergalm share their excitement at the possibility of missions to Europa and Enceladus to find marine life.
So @shasta721 says absolutely yes. @SethShostak agrees because the -possibility- garners huge news headlines.
"Bill Diamond to panel: ""Do you think it will be equally transformative to find past life...""  somewhere like Mars? #SETITalks #SVGives"
"In the end, @MarkRShowalter gives it a 50/50 chance that we find life elsewhere in the solar system or further away."
Here's the game @MarkRShowalter says we have to play to get to intelligent life. The question marks are checkpoints https://t.co/hfTW2GLikw
"Last but not least, @MarkRShowalter takes a ""mathematical approach"" and sides with @SethShostak about ETI. Talking probabilities now."
We need to look for co-evolution of life and environment because they go hand in hand. -- @shasta721
"Now @shasta721 is talking about how ""notions of habitability"" have changed over the past 50 years from planets to moons outside HZ."
"Searching on Mars using missions like @ESA_ExoMars which is sniffing for methane are the ""first place"" we'll find other life says @shasta721"
It is @shasta721's turn with the microphone. She's talking about the similarities between Mars in the past and Earth now.
Scientist @fergalm predicts 30-40 years to solve technical problems and launch mission to find exoplanetary life.

"Earthlink planets = about the size of Earth and similar orbital period to Earth, at least when it comes to the @NASAKepler mission."
"Now @fergalm takes over, changing from detecting ETI signals to looking for exoplanets, especially using @NASAKepler."
Laughter as @SethShostak talks about the lack of interest in the mere possibility of a detection. No way to keep story quiet WHEN it happens
Scientist @SethShostak says we know the size of the hay stack and tech is getting better. ET life will be found within 2 dozen years.
Panel beginning after congratulating and thanking Bill Borucki for all his work on exoplanets. @SethShostak giving first 5-min opinion.

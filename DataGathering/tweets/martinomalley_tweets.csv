Every place of worship in U.S. should post a sign near their entrance this weekend that reads: 'Immigrants Welcome'
"When @realDonaldTrump is done playing Emperor &amp; hate-monger, maybe he and his Republican Congress can pass Immigration Reform #NoBanNoWall"
Cities and states are right not to allow their local police officers to be turned in immigrant round-up drag nets
The notion that cities and states are giving 'sanctuary' to dangerous immigrant criminals is factually untrue
"If immigrants are afraid to call the police for anything, then crime will rise, not fall. Procedures exist to remove truly violent criminals"
Just because many of our immigrant neighbors can't yet get through our broken immigration system doesn't make them a threat to public safety
New White House executive order of the day would punish churches &amp; places of worship that minister to immigrants. Very decidedly UN-American

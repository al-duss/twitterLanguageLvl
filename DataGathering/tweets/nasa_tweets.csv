"@InasAhmed16 We think they are tidally locked to their host star, which means they would have permanent night/day sides."
@norgrove_c The TRAPPIST-1 system is about 40 light-years from Earth.
"@ingermann_ Yes, these planets are tidally locked."
@braydenx2 The first planet in the TRAPPIST-1 system was detected in 2013.
"@AlineUrbiola The next step is continued study of the TRAPPIST-1 system with @NASA_Hubble, @NASAspitzer, @NASAKepler and soon @NASAWebb"
@ReviewMathUSA @lizlandau The TRAPPIST-1 star and the 7 planets orbiting it are at least 500 million years old.
"@plannopoetico The TRAPPIST-1 star &amp; the 7 planets orbiting it are at least 500 million years old. TRAPPIST-1A, the star, does burn hydrogen"
@aeonszero_ They do not appear to have moons.
@RyanBeverley We still don't know about the presence of planets further out in the solar system. We'll have to continue our observations.
"Around a nearby, cold, small star we found 7 rocky Earth-size planets, all of which could have liquid water - key t\u2026 https://t.co/YSskwc0K47"
@ashren The @NASAWebb will provide higher resolution information about the planet's atmospheres.
"@DdoubleJ_OB We could probe this system using space-based telescopes in our solar system, like we doing now with @NASA_Hubble and others."
"@joestandman The planets are quite close to their star. For perspective, all 7 would fit within the orbit of Mercury in our solar system."
@tonedspark The TRAPPIST-1 star and its planets are a minimum of 500 million years old.
@EireBen All of them could potentially harbor water. Stay tuned for updates from @NASA_Hubble &amp; @NASAWebb for more on this.
@Daveton03 Their orbital periods determine whether the planet is inside the habitable zone.
@rbrXlarabee We don't know yet! Stay tuned for further findings from @NASA_Hubble and @NASAWebb
"@kb7zrb Probably constant. Given their orbital configuration, it seems unlikely that they would have seasons."
@ebonyavajohnson It would be like seeing the features you're able to view on our moon from Earth! Pretty neat!
@19SkyBlue87 This system is located about 40 light-years from Earth. Not sure about Buzz Lightyear though!
"@TheAnaMk To study the basics of these planets, like their size &amp; atmospheres, we don't need to compensate for the 40 year light difference."
"@pibyte Not at this time, but perhaps with better and longer observation with newer telescopes like @NASAWebb telescope"
"@WilliamShatner Right now we've only confirmed the 7, but we are looking for more using @NASAspitzer and @NASAKepler!"
"@DylanDeeble There will be other systems more amenable to ""images"". For these a few years before seeing their atmospheres another way."
@yurii2710 None that we know of. Their years span from 1 - 20 days.
@LaunchComplex This is normal for a small mass star and this is not a problem for life.
